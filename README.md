# Villager Brain Config

Villager Brain Config is a lightweight Minecraft mod that gives server owners, modpack creators, and technical players full control over villager movement penalties (maluses). Fully configure how villagers perceive different terrain types, influence pathfinding, and make villages feel smarter (or dumber) with a config file.

---

## Features

- **Custom block malus values**: Assign movement penalties to any block (e.g., water = 10.0, path = 0.0, soul sand = 4.0)
- **Profession configs**: Create different malus behaviors for different villager professions
- **Cross-mod compatibility**: The mod should work with any modded or vanilla villager professions
- **Simple JSON config system**: Easy to edit, reload, and distribute with modpacks
- **Server-side only**: No need for clients to install it

## Planned Features

- **Block malus radius**: Assign a malus and a radius to a block, profession specific (eg. Nitwits avoid walking within 4 blocks of a bookshelf or a job site)

## Compatibility

- Minecraft 1.21.1 planned (more versions down the road)
- Fabric and NeoForge support
- Supports modded villager professions and any modded blocks or tags
